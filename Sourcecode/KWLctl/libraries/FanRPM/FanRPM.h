 * @brief Stores measurements and computes fan speed.
 *
 * This class measures rotations per minute of a fan reporting its speed
 * by sending a signal once per rotation. The signal is captured from a pin
 * using an associated interrupt. Interrupt's handling routine must call
 * interrupt() routine.
 *
 * To read the measurement, call get_speed() routine.
 *
 * You can dump the internal state to serial console using dump() method,
 * but this method is not synchronized (i.e., it may report erratic data).
