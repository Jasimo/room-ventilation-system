/*!
 * @brief Simple scheduler for cooperative multitasking.
 *
 * The scheduler works by maintaining two tasks lists - a queue of pending tasks
 * and a list of current tasks. When the scheduler runs one loop, it picks any
 * expired tasks from the current task list, removes them and runs them. Tasks
 * can re-add themselves into the scheduler, but they will end up in pending
 * queue.
 *
 * When the entire current task list is processed in one loop() call, the pending
 * queue becomes the current task list and unless it was once already switched to
 * pending task queue, it will be processed in the same loop call.
 *
 * If not entire current task list is processed in one loop() call (typical), then
 * the pending queue is added at the end of the current task list and will be
 * processed in the next scheduler run.
 *
 * This way, it is guaranteed that all tasks get processed at some time, even if
 * there is a misbehaving task registering itself over and over with zero timeout.
 * This misbehaving task will run only at most twice per scheduler loop and other
 * tasks will get their chance to run.
