/*!
 * @brief Simple scheduler for cooperative multitasking.
 *
 * The scheduler works by maintaining a task list. Each task has an associated
 * next schedule time and optionally interval time. When the scheduler runs one
 * loop, it picks any expired tasks from the task list, removes them and runs
 * them. Task can re-add themselves into the scheduler, but they will be only
 * executed in the next scheduler loop. If a task specified a scheduling interval,
 * then the scheduler will automatically re-add it after execution.
 *
 * This way, it is guaranteed that all tasks get processed at some time, even if
 * there is a misbehaving task registering itself over and over with zero timeout.
 * This misbehaving task will run only at most once per scheduler loop and other
 * tasks will get their chance to run.
 *
 * Additionally, tasks can override poll() method to be called every time the
 * scheduler runs. This is for instance needed to interface with user input or
 * network handling.
