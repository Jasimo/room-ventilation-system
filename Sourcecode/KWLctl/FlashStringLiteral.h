 * Typically, such literals will be used as constexpr constants like this:
 * @code
 * constexpr auto MyString = makeFlashLiteral("MyString");
 * @endcode
 *
 * Resulting literal is convertible to <tt>const __FlashStringHelper*</tt>,
 * so it can be used directly in routines expecting a string in Flash.
 * Using FlashStringLiteral::load() method, it is possible to create a temporary
 * on stack containing the string in RAM, so it can be passed as
 * <tt>const char*</tt> as necessary. Just pay attention to lifecycle of the
 * temporary.
